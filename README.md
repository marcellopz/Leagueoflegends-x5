This website is a dedicated platform designed to provide me and my friends with a convenient and efficient way to balance our matche, track our individual performance and review past match history. 
Developed using React and integrated with the Google Firebase Realtime Database, this website does something we used to have to do manually, balancing our custom games and calculating basic statistics such as win rate and other performance stats.

## Key Features:

* Player Stat Tracking: Easily monitor and analyze the performance of each player with detailed player statistics. Keep track of essential metrics such as win rates, KDA ratios, vision scores and other key indicators to gauge your progress and identify areas for improvement.

* Match History: Access detailed information about previous matches, including game details, individual performances, and strategic choices made during gameplay.

* User-Friendly Interface: The website features a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and quick access to your stats and match history. The intuitive design ensures a hassle-free experience while exploring your gaming data.

* Respect of my friends privacy: The public version of the website contains generic versions of each "card", logging in and requesting permission can grant you permission to see the pictures used for each player.

* Front-End Development: Built with React, the website offers a responsive and interactive interface.

* Data Storage: The integration of the Google Firebase Realtime Database ensures reliable data storage and synchronization, providing real-time updates to keep your statistics and match history up to date.

This website serves as a personalized tool for me and my friends to track our stats and review past custom matches played. It aims to provide a convenient and centralized platform for us to gain insights into their performance and make data-driven decisions to enhance our fun and gameplay strategies.
